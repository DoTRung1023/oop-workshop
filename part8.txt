What is the sequence of events when you call dynamicArray, printArray, 
and arrayMax in this part?
- I will initialise a dynamic array, print all values in that array, and find the maximum 
value in the array.

What would happen if we deallocated the dynamic array before calling arrayMax or printArray?
- There will be segmentation fault because we dont have access deallocated memory in the 
dynamic array.
